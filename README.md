# react-form

## How I worked on this project

- I used React Hooks in the main branch which was my first commit, I commented code pertaining to each of the hooks used.
- useRef and useState.
- Both hooks were used to demostrate how both would work.


## How to navigate this project

- There is only one CSS file index.css
- This is a basic form which has two components exported to App.js, which is main file.


## Why I built the project this way

- I built this project to possibly save me time on building forms and as a resource for myself since what I needed could not be found, so far..

## If I had more time I would change this

- I would attempt different styling/code to see if there is a better way to get information from user or to possibly clean up code a bit. So far it looks good.
